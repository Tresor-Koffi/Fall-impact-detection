## üìÑ Abstract

Falls among individuals, especially the elderly population, can lead to serious injuries and complications. This work addresses the challenge of detecting **impact moments** within fall events using multisensor data. We apply thorough preprocessing techniques to the UP-FALL dataset, employ feature selection to identify relevant features, and evaluate various machine learning models for accurate impact detection. Our approach achieves **99.5% accuracy** with SVM, demonstrating the power of leveraging multisensor data for fall detection tasks.

## üéØ Key Contributions

1. **Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline**: Novel preprocessing technique that eliminates noise and improves data quality by combining SMV (Signal Magnitude Vector) with threshold-based methods (2g threshold).

2. **Feature Selection Process**: Employed Random Forest-based feature ranking using Gini impurity to identify the top 5 most relevant features from 37 available features in the UP-FALL dataset.

3. **Machine Learning Comparison**: Evaluated 8 different ML algorithms for impact detection, with SVM achieving the highest accuracy (99.5%) and fastest inference time.

## üöÄ Key Results

| Algorithm | Accuracy | Recall | Precision | F1-Score | Training Time (s) |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **SVM** | **99.50%** | 99.50% | 99.50% | 99.50% | 0.059 |
| Gradient Boosting | 99.35% | 98.65% | 98.84% | 98.74% | 0.844 |
| Random Forest | 99.28% | 98.47% | 99.18% | 98.47% | 0.607 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 98.35% | 98.45% | 99.03% | 98.74% | 0.005 |

## üìä Dataset

This work uses the **UP-FALL Dataset** - a multimodal dataset for fall detection:
- **Activities**: 11 distinct fall activities + 6 Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)
- **Trials**: Each activity performed 3 times
- **Sensors**: Multiple accelerometers, gyroscopes, EEG sensors, and vision devices
- **Dataset Link**: [UP-FALL Dataset](https://sites.google.com/up.edu.mx/har-up/)

### Top 5 Selected Features (by Gini Impurity):
1. Ankle Accelerometer X-axis (Ank_ACCX)
2. Belt Accelerometer Y-axis (BeltACCY)
3. Ankle Accelerometer Y-axis (Ank_ACCY)
4. Neck Accelerometer Z-axis (NeckACCZ)
5. Belt Accelerometer Z-axis (BeltACCZ)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tresor-Koffi/fall-detection-ml.git
cd fall-detection-ml
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## üíª Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Download the UP-FALL Dataset** from the official source and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
```bash
jupyter notebook impact_fall_detection.ipynb
3. **Run all cells** to reproduce the results from the paper.

### Pipeline Overview

The notebook implements the following pipeline:

```python
# 1. Data Loading
# Load UP-FALL multisensor data

# 2. Preprocessing
# - Z-score normalization
# - SMV (Signal Magnitude Vector) calculation
# - Threshold-based filtering (2g threshold)
# - Semi-automatic labeling with visual validation

# 3. Feature Selection
# - Random Forest feature importance
# - Select top 5 features based on Gini impurity

# 4. Model Training & Evaluation
# - Train 8 ML models (SVM, RF, GB, KNN, NB, DT, LR, SGD)
# - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
# - Generate ROC curves and confusion matrices
```

## üî¨ Methodology

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Synchronization**: Align sensor data with visual data using timestamps
2. **Normalization**: Apply Z-score normalization to all 37 features
3. **SMV Calculation**: Compute Signal Magnitude Vector: `SMV = ‚àö(Ax¬≤ + Ay¬≤ + Az¬≤)`
4. **Threshold Application**: Use 2g threshold to detect fall events
5. **Semi-automatic Labeling**: Validate impact detection with visual frames

### Feature Selection
- Method: Random Forest with Gini Impurity
- Selected: Top 5 features out of 37
- Reason: Balance between model complexity and performance

### Machine Learning Models
